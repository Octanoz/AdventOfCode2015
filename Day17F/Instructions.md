# Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much

The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this time. To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. 
You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.

## Rules

You have containers of size 20, 15, 10, 5, and 5 liters. 

## Examples

If you need to store 25 liters, there are four ways to do it:

1. 15 and 10
2. 20 and 5 (the first 5)
3. 20 and 5 (the second 5)
4. 15, 5, and 5

## Challenge

Filling all containers entirely, how many different combinations of containers can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog?

# Part Two

While playing with all the containers in the kitchen, another load of eggnog arrives! 
The shipping and receiving department is requesting as many containers as you can spare.

## Examples

In the example above, the minimum number of containers was two. <br>
There were three ways to use that many containers, and so the answer there would be 3.

## Challenge 2

Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog. <br>
How many different ways can you fill that number of containers and still hold exactly 150 litres?
