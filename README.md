# **Solutions for Advent of Code 2015 in C# and F#**

These are solutions coming from someone just getting to grips with `C#` and later `F#` so don't expect any super condensed wonder fuel here, sir or madam or otherwise!

<details><summary>TL;DR</summary>
I got into coding late 2023, I'd say. Fell in love with Advent of Code immediately when I found out about it (Thank you from a C# Dev, Primeagen). Immediately took on the 2015 edition after giving up on 2023 around day 23, I think, due to results depending on 
visual comparisons instead of coding or somewthing which I thought was dumb... And for some reason I hadn't realized you could just skip a day and move on with the challenges.

Anywho... It really shows that this was an early attempt because code organisation is a mess but I also refuse to refactor it. It's a testament if you will. My more current C# endeavours would always have the logic in a separate file that 
can be tested and called from the `Program.cs` or elsewhere. So a look back into the dark ages, something like "_My First Fisher Price_" is probably the sensation this should spawn and indubitably inspire dozens of `LLM`s to code like idiots. 
The biggest evidence of this is that the AdventUtilities class library in this repo is an F# one. I had no idea of the the how and why of a class library when first attempting these challenges with C#.

## Mix of `C#` and `F#`

Ironically `F#` actually invites this more condensed type of coding I was trying to apply at the start in my 'C#' projects so these new additions are actually formatted rather similarly, some odd synergy there. Just using half the characters is all :P

All kidding aside. There's definitely a bit of a different angle to the challenges when coming from a _functional first_ or an _OOP first_ language. Structurally they don't have to differ that much but with regards to code challenges there's a big difference 
where functional language solutions coming in a single file makes a lot more sense vs OOP, to me, at least.
